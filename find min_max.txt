Explainations:-

The pair class is defined with two public integer variables: min and max. This class will be used to store the minimum and maximum values.

The getminmax method is defined as a static method. It takes two parameters: an integer array arr and the size of the array n. This method returns an object of the pair class.

Inside the getminmax method, the pair object minmax is created.

The Arrays.sort method is used to sort the array in ascending order.

The minimum value is assigned to minmax.min by accessing the first element of the sorted array (arr[0]).

The maximum value is assigned to minmax.max by accessing the last element of the sorted array (arr[n-1]).

The minmax object is returned.

In the main method, an integer array arr is initialized with some values.

The size of the array is calculated using the length property of the array.

The getminmax method is called with the arr and size parameters, and the returned minmax object is stored in a variable.

The minimum and maximum values are printed using System.out.println.
